# pumpkin

Pumpkin is a web based Desired State Configuration (DSC) pull server based on ASP.NET Core 1.0. Pumpkin is designed from the ground up to run on the .NET Core CLR. As such, it is designed to run on a variety of hosting environments including Windows Nano Server and Linux. Bascially, if a hosting environment can run the .NET Core CLR then it can host a DSC pull server using pumpkin.
